# Matt's Posts

A website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts to a forum. It was created using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. It also uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to provide user authentication. It is deployed through [Render](https://render.com/).
If a user is not signed in, they can only view posts. If they are signed in, they can create a post. They can also update or delete their own posts.
